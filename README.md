# Number Guesser Website
Project from Codecademy in which a simple web-based number guessing game was created.  Player guesses at a target number against the computer.  

Index.html, Style.css, Game.js were all provided for the project.

Script.js is the file I created to make the game work.  Game theory is based on random number generation for the target and the computer guess.
